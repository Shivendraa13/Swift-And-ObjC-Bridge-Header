# Swift-And-ObjC-Bridge-Header üõ†Ô∏è

This project demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate Objective-C code into a Swift project using a bridging header. It includes examples of calling Objective-C methods from Swift and vice versa, showcasing interoperability between the two languages.

---

## Features
- **Swift & Objective-C Interoperability**: Integrate legacy Objective-C code into modern Swift projects.
- **Bridging Header**: Use the bridging header to expose Objective-C classes, methods, and properties to Swift.
- **Call Objective-C Methods in Swift**: Demonstrate invoking Objective-C methods from Swift.
- **Call Swift Methods in Objective-C**: Enable Swift classes to be used in Objective-C when marked with `@objc`.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Swift**: Primary language for the app.
- **Objective-C**: Used for specific functionalities and demonstrating interoperability.
- **Xcode**: Integrated Development Environment for building the project.
